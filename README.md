# GraphNeuralNetwork
A 2-layer GNN model ensures Graph Convolutions by ReLu activations, made a histogram to visualise the distribution of learned node embeddings. The GNN Layer does message passing - multiplying the adjacency matrix with input features.  This shows the basic working of a graph neural network in PyTorch .
